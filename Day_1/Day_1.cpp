//For example, if the device displays frequency changes of +1, -2, +3, +1, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:
//Current frequency  0, change of + 1; resulting frequency  1.
//Current frequency  1, change of - 2; resulting frequency - 1.
//Current frequency - 1, change of + 3; resulting frequency  2.
//Current frequency  2, change of + 1; resulting frequency  3.
